## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Created a counter using javascript, that took forever. Learned that using forwards as an animation fill mode affected my pseudo-class(:before) therefore rendering the z-index useless. Can't wrap my head around why that happended.

### Continued development

Learning never stops.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://github.com/Frontend-Wizard/Time-tracking-dashboard) - I got the counter idea from here.
